# Project Guidelines

## Project Purpose
The **Study Schedule Generator** aims to provide students with an easy-to-use tool to manage their study time effectively, making it accessible to a wide range of users regardless of their technical skills.

## Contribution Etiquette
1. Be respectful when reviewing or commenting on code.
2. Maintain a professional tone when interacting with contributors.
3. When suggesting changes, explain your reasoning clearly and provide alternatives if possible.

## Versioning
We follow **Semantic Versioning**:
- **MAJOR** for incompatible API changes,
- **MINOR** for adding functionality in a backward-compatible manner, and
- **PATCH** for backward-compatible bug fixes.

## Branching Strategy
- **main**: Contains stable, released code.
- **develop**: Contains code in active development.
- Create feature branches off `develop` for new features, and use the following format:
   - `feature/feature-name`
   - `bugfix/bug-description`

## Code Review Process
- Each pull request must be reviewed by at least one maintainer before being merged.
- Focus on readability, maintainability, and adherence to coding standards during reviews.

## Testing Guidelines
- Tests should be included for any new functionality.
- Use the provided test framework to write unit tests where applicable.

## Communication Channels
- Use GitHub issues for all communication related to the project.
- Label your issues appropriately (e.g., bug, feature, documentation).
